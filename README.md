# Drone Route Optimizer

## Introduction
Submission repository for KnightHacks VIII and part of the NextEra Energy challenge track. Our team was drawn into this challenge because of NextEra's values as well as providing an opportunity to learn more about mathematics, algorithms, optimization, and other tools that we felt weren't provided by the other sponsor tracks. Since half of our team members had machine learning and algorithm experience, this track proved to be a challenging but interesting project. Because our team memembers wanted to push our understanding of algortihm and the interconnections between nodes and edges, NextEra gave us the opportunity to explore more mathematics at a mostly software development event.
